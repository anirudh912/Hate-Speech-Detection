# Hate-Speech-Detection

Hate speech can be a very problematic thing considering the impact and influence of our life online to our life in the real world and mental health. This algorithm is aimed at efficiently detecting and categorizing hate speech tweets in order to flag and take viable action on the accounts posting them.

Consists of a basic accuracy comparison between 3 different classifier models:
   1. XGBoost Classifier - 90.886 % accurate
   2. Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier - 96.669 % accurate
   3. Naive Bayes Classifier - 95.233 % accurate

Comparison gives insights on what algorithm may work better on a fairly large dataset by default, without any hyperparameter tuning.
